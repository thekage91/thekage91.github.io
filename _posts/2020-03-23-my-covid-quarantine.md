Hi, 
sorry but this post will be very very short with some key points about my future task. 
This is absolutely my first post in English on this blog and I would like to tell you what I am going to do during this quarantine due to Coronavirus. 

I am in Italy and the entire country is in lockdown and we must to stay at home to avoid the diffusion of the virus. My mood isn't very well but I am trying to focus on something new to enhance it.

## What I am going to do
I am trying to building something to relaunch my job and my jurney. Everything will be expressed by a task list  
- Launch [spacedcards.com](spacedcards.com) around Anki fields
- Develop new site for my company [Sprint Studio](sprintstudio.co)
- Write more post on this blog documenting my journey
- Read more books, I hope to read two books during this time
- Grow my English skills and my vocabulary
